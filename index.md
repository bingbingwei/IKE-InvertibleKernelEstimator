### Introduction
We address the task of zero-shot blind image super-resolution and propose a flow-based generative model, named as invertible kernel estimator (IKE) which aims to recover the high-resolution details from the low-resolution input image under a challenging problem setting of having no external training data, no prior assumption on the downsampling kernel, and no pre-training components used for estimating the downsampling kernel.

### Algorithm
IKENet approximates the image downsampling and upsampling processes simultaneously via a flow-based generative model. Thanks to the invertibility of IKENet, the forward and backward flows are directly linked to the downsampling/kernel-estimating and upsampling/super-resolving steps. We provide the detailed algorithms of the forward and backward processes of the proposed IKENet with the following video.

### Experiments and Results
#### DIV2k Track 2 (unknown degradation)
The following table presents the super-resolved images on DIV2K dataset Track 2. The first two and the last two rows are the results of upsampling by 2 times and 4 times respectively.
