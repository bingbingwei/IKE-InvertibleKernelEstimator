### Introduction
We address the task of zero-shot blind image super-resolution and propose a flow-based generative model, named as invertible kernel estimator (IKE) which aims to recover the high-resolution details from the low-resolution input image under a challenging problem setting of having no external training data, no prior assumption on the downsampling kernel, and no pre-training components used for estimating the downsampling kernel.

### Algorithm
IKE approximates the image downsampling and upsampling processes simultaneously via a flow-based generative model. Thanks to the invertibility of IKE, the forward and backward flows of our IKE are directly linked to the downsampling/kernel estimating and upsampling/super resolving steps. We provide the detailed algorithms of the forward and backward processes of the proposed IKENet with the following video.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bingbingwei/IKE-InvertibleKernelEstimator/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
